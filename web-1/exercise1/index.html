    <p>I am a photographer for a local piercing studio, and have been working with them for almost 3 years. I also work as a receptionist for a local tattoo studio. I'm 19 years old, and have a pet dog named Senie. She is my child and I would dropkick an infant for her with no remorse. <strong>LOOK AT HOW CUTE SHE IS OMG WIGVEDIPA8FHUE</strong></p>
